    "### Types of Data and their meaning\n",
    "**Data** refers to raw facts or information—whether numerical, textual, or visual—that are collected and organized for analysis, interpretation, or decision-making. It can be of many types and many format. But we can generally divide _Data_ into two types:\n",
    "1. **Quantitative Data** is numerical and measurable with numbers. This type of data can be countable or calculable. Another way to say that, if you can ask \"_How Much_\" or \"_How Many_\" and get an answer that has numerical values, then it is **Quantitative Data**. For example: Height, Age, Distance, Grade, pH level, etc.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Qualitative Data** is descriptive and not measurable. This type of data is oftenly observable or perceivable. Another way to put this, if you can ask \"_Why_\" or \"_How_\" and get an answer that has descriptive meaning, then it is **Qualitative Data**. For example: Colors, Opinions, Observations, survey response, attitude, etc.\n",
